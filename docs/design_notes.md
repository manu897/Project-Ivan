# Design Notes for Ivan AR Helmet HUD

## Project Architecture

The Ivan AR Helmet HUD project is designed to integrate a minimal head-up display (HUD) into a motorcycle helmet. The architecture consists of the following key components:

1. **ESP32-S3 Board**: The main processing unit that handles data processing, display control, and sensor integration.
2. **Display**: A 1.3" IPS LCD with ST7789V2 driver, used for rendering the HUD interface.
3. **Prism Cube**: An optical component that allows the display to be viewed clearly within the helmet.
4. **IMU Sensor**: The QMI8658 IMU provides motion and orientation data to enhance user interaction and tracking capabilities.
5. **Power Management**: A battery management system to ensure reliable power supply to the components.

## User Interface Concepts

The user interface is designed to be minimalistic and non-intrusive, providing essential information without distracting the rider. Key UI elements include:

- **Digital Clock**: Displays the current time prominently.
- **Navigation Overlays**: Future implementation will include navigation prompts and directions.
- **Sensor Readings**: Information such as speed, battery status, and alerts will be displayed as overlays.

## Hardware Integration

### ESP32-S3 Board
- The ESP32-S3 will be programmed using the ESP-IDF framework, allowing for efficient resource management and real-time performance.
- The board will interface with the LCD via SPI and communicate with the IMU over I2C.

### Display
- The ST7789V2 driver will be utilized to control the display, with functions for initialization, data transmission, and rendering graphics.
- The display will be mounted within the helmet, aligned with the prism cube for optimal visibility.

### IMU Sensor
- The QMI8658 IMU will be integrated to provide motion tracking capabilities, enabling future gesture recognition and head tracking features.
- Functions will be implemented to read data from the IMU and process it for use in the HUD.

## Future Work
- Implement IMU-based movement tracking to enhance user interaction.
- Develop Bluetooth audio features for alerts and notifications.
- Finalize the UCS-mounted battery system for seamless power integration.

## Conclusion

The Ivan AR Helmet HUD project aims to create a functional and innovative augmented reality experience for motorcycle riders. The design notes outlined above provide a foundation for development and integration of the various components, ensuring a cohesive and user-friendly product.
